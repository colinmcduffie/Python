Sample Python Scripts
This is a folder with various files needed to create the data source for this work in progress Tableau Dashboard:

1) Use the Web Traffic Dummy Data to create your own random dummy data to practice on. If you have your own data from Google Analytics etc. Then you can skip this step.
2) Open and run the Dummy Web Revenue Forecast Model 1.ipynb to explore your data and run your first ML model. I added the script for a Random Forest Model but feel free to use Linear Regression or any model you're curious about.
3) Decide which features you want to keep and which ones to omit. Rerun the workflow unitl you get a desired R2.
4) You are now ready to move onto the Full Dummy Web Forecast (Final) (1).ipynb script. This is much more complex but shows all the necessary steps needed to create the final dataset.
